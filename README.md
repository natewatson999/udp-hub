# udp-hub
UDP-hub is a Node.js module designed to provide a module similar to the dgram module that Node provides natively, with the only difference being that dgram requires the developer to handle IPv4 and IPv6, whearas upd-hub is supposed to allow the developer to handle them as one. So rather than making two servers, one for IPv4, and one for IPv6; you can just make one server that can handle both.

This module is published under the MIT license.
